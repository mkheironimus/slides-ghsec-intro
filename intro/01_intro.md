# GitHub
* Hosted git repositories and collaboration tools
* So popular for open source that people assume it's what you use
* So popular that some less-experienced people think git == GitHub
* See also: BitBucket, GitLab (especially if you use private repos)

~~~SECTION:notes~~~

GitHub == git is especially common for some younger people because to them it's
always been there.

# An infrastructure guy using GitHub? Sure!
* Automation, infrastructure-as-code
* Open-source tools, sharing quick hacks
* Companies host their private app repos on GitHub
* Maintaining in-house source code repositories

~~~SECTION:notes~~~

An infrastructure guy telling you how to correctly work with a source code
management system is only strange at first glance, but perfectly reasonable.
That said, I only created an actual account last year. Now that I have it, I
use it.
